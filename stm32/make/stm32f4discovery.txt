# Arduino IDE variable equivalents used in Makefiles
#
# The Arduino IDE defines a number of variables in its Java
# code.  It usually uses those variables itself for compiling
# the source code into objects and then into binaries, doing
# in Java pretty much similar things than what make does.
#
# In this file, we define the variables that the Arduino IDE
# Java code usually defines, so that reading the Arduino
# definitions from makefiles work correctly.
#
# So: This file is *not* used by the IDE.  This file is used
# by the make system to be compatible with the IDE.
